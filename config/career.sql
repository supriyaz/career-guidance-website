	(9, 'Who Controls Your Mind?', 'Who_Controls_Your_Mind.jpg', '<p>Few people are aware of the thoughts that pass through their minds, since most thinking is done in an automatic manner. The mind is sometimes, like small child, who accepts, and takes for \r\ngranted, whatever it sees or hears, without judgment and without \r\nconsidering the consequences. If you let your mind behave in this \r\nmanner, giving it complete freedom to jump from one thought to another, \r\nyou lose your freedom. We are constantly flooded with thoughts, ideas and information coming \r\nthrough the five senses, other people, the newspapers and TV. These \r\nthoughts, ideas and information penetrate the mind, whether we are aware\r\n of this process or not. This flow of thoughts affects our behavior and reactions. It influences \r\nthe way we think, our preferences, likes and dislikes. Usually, we \r\nautomatically accept these thoughts, letting them shape our life. This \r\nactually means that we lose our mental freedom. Most people think and believe that their thoughts originate from them, \r\nbut have you ever stopped and considered whether your thoughts, desires,\r\n likes and dislikes are really yours? Did it occur to you that maybe \r\nthey came from the outside, from other people, and you have \r\nunconsciously accepted them as your own? <strong>If you do not filter the thoughts that enter your mind you stop to be a free person</strong>, and allow every thought to control your life. You may object, and say that the thoughts that pass through your mind \r\nare yours, but are they? Have you deliberately and attentively created \r\nevery thought that entered your mind? <br></p><ol><li>Why let outside influences control your mind and life? </li><li>Why let other people\'s thoughts control your life and mind? </li><li>Do you want to make your mind free or do you prefer to enslave it to other people\'s opinions and thoughts?</li></ol><p>If you leave your mind open to every thought that passes by, you put our\r\n life in other people\'s hands, and without realizing it, you accept \r\ntheir thoughts and act in accordance with them. Every person is differently affected by external thoughts. Certain \r\nthoughts and ideas we ignore, and others spur us to immediate action. \r\nUsually, thoughts concerning subjects we love have more power on us than\r\n other thoughts, but even thoughts and ideas that we don\'t care about, \r\nif we are frequently exposed to them, eventually sink into the \r\nsubconscious mind and affect us. Everyone has desires, ambitions and dreams that he or she may foster \r\nfrom childhood. However, it is possible that they are the thoughts of \r\nparents, teachers and friends, which have lodged into their mind, and \r\nwere carried throughout their lives. <strong>Are these thoughts necessary? Do we need all this excessive baggage?</strong> In order to reduce the power of outside influences and thoughts on your \r\nlife, you need to be aware of the thoughts and desires that enter your \r\nmind, and ask yourself, whether you really like them, and if you are \r\nwilling to accept them into your life.&nbsp; You do not have to accept each and every thought that enters your mind.&nbsp; Find out whether it is your own thought, or someone else\'s thought. \r\nAlso, decide whether the thought is useful for you, and if it is for \r\nyour own good to follow. This will lead to more control over your \r\nthinking process. It might not be so easy do at first, because your mind will probably \r\nrevolt against this control. However, if you want to be the master of \r\nyour mind and life, you should not let other people\'s thoughts rule your\r\n life, unless you consciously choose so.</p>', 'November-25-2016', 'Admin', '2016-11-25 16:44:31'),
